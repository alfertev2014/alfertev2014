- 👋 Hi, I’m @alfertev2014 (Vasiliy Alfertev). I'm software developer. I have experience in web-development (front-end and back-end) and system programming in Linux.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, programming languages, paradigms, programming styles, best practices, compilers and runtime environments. I have practical experience in TypeScript (JavaScript), C++ and Java. I'm very interesting in learning Scala, Kotlin, Rust, OCaml, Scheme, Haskell.
- 🌱 I’m currently very interested in TypeScript and GUI development using HTML5 and CSS. I continue grasping nuances of microservice architecture, distributed systems and DevOps. Also, I understand features of the latest C++ standard and system programming in Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development of common libraries and solutions to reduce complexity of software systems and development. I'm designing a simple LISP-like programming language for education. Also, I try to find out the ways of using bare C++ with std and vanilla JavaScript (TypeScript) to reach all the needed functionalities for the real world programming (frameworkless development).
