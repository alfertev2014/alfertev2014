- 👋 Hi, I’m @alfertev2014 (Vasiliy Alfertev). I'm software developer. I have experience in Linux system programming, web-development, back-end and front-end.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, programming languages, paradigms, programming styles, best practices, compilers and runtime environments. I have practical experience in C++, JavaScript, Java. I'm very interesting in learning Scala, Kotlin, Rust, OCaml, Haskell.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning features of the latest C++ standard. Also, I'm very interested in TypeScript and GUI development using HTML5 and CSS. Yet, I continue grasping nuances of microservice architecture and DevOps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development of common libraries and solutions to reduce complexity of software systems and development. I'm designing a simple LISP-like programming language for education. Also, I try to find out the ways of using bare C++ with std and vanilla JavaScript (TypeScript) to reach all the needed functionalities for the real world programming (frameworkless development).
